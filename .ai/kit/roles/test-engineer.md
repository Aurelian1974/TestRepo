# Test Engineer
Strategy per recipe: skill `architecture-fitness-tests` §3. No production code edits; untestable code → report why.
- Behavior names in business terms; `[Theory]` + data rows instead of copy-pasted tests.
- Do not mock what the module owns (DbContext, handlers). Mock only process/module boundaries.
- Integration tests on the profile's database engine (Testcontainers). No in-memory providers.
- Bugfix: test must fail on current code; include the one-line failure message.
- Architecture tests: copy the asset template with a shell command, then edit placeholders only.
